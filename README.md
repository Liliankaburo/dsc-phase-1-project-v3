# Introduction

Despite the number of aviation accidents recorded over the years,flying remains the safest mode of transport.In comparison to accidents and fatalities from let's say road transport,aviation accidents are not as frequent.That said,aviation industry is a lucrative venture but not without its risks and limitations.This projects aims to identify risk factors that contribute to accident occurrences and how they relate to specific aircraft models to assist company stakeholders make informed decisions on which aircraft model is suited best for new venture into the aviation industry.

# Project Overview

This project,using the data from NTSB Aviation Accidents dataset(1962-2023), aims to assess and identify the aircraft model with the lowest risk factors that affect and contribute to the frequency and severity of aviation accidents. The information derived from an extensive analysis of the available data will help in making informed decisions in purchasing the aircraft to venture into the aviation industry.

The aviation industry presents unique challenges, and a thorough assessment of historical accident data is essential to inform our purchasing decisions. This project aims to analyze aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to identify the safest aircraft options for our new business endeavors

# Business Understanding / Problem Statement

Green Collar Solutions Limited is expanding into new industries to diversify its portfolio. Among those being considered by the company's stakeholders is a venture into the Aviation industries (purchasing and operating aircfats for commercial and private enterprises).My task in this project is to answer the following questions for the stakeholders.

(i). What are the risk factors associated with different aircrafts?

(ii). Do the accidents rates depend on whether the aircraft is commercial or private?

(iii). Does the model of an aircraft minimize or increase it's risk factors?

Answers to these questions will determine which model,where privately or commercially operated, has the lowest risks of getting into an accident regardless of other factors like weather or human error etc.

# Introduction

Despite the number of aviation accidents recorded over the years,flying remains the safest mode of transport.In comparison to accidents and fatalities from let's say road transport,aviation accidents are not as frequent.That said,aviation industry is a lucrative venture but not without its risks and limitations.This projects aims to identify risk factors that contribute to accident occurrences and how they relate to specific aircraft models to assist company stakeholders make informed decisions on which aircraft model is suited best for new venture into the aviation industry.

# Project Overview

This project,using the data from NTSB Aviation Accidents dataset(1962-2023), aims to assess and identify the aircraft model with the lowest risk factors that affect and contribute to the frequency and severity of aviation accidents. The information derived from an extensive analysis of the available data will help in making informed decisions in purchasing the aircraft to venture into the aviation industry.

The aviation industry presents unique challenges, and a thorough assessment of historical accident data is essential to inform our purchasing decisions. This project aims to analyze aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to identify the safest aircraft options for our new business endeavors.

# Primary objective
Deep analysis of the data to get clear assessments of the risks so that i can provide insightful information to guide the company's stakeholders in making guided decisions towards their new venture.

# specific Objectives

1.Data collection>>> get data from NTSB aviation accidents report for 1962-2023

2.Data cleaning or preprocessing data using pandas libraries in Python

3.Data exploration - doing an indepth data analysis of the report to show trends,factor relationships and patterns(EDA)

4.Actionable insights and recommendations - translate the findings of the Exploratory data analysis into actionable insights and recommendations.

5.Effective visualizations to communicate the insights and recommendations to Green collar Solutions limited stakeholders to help them in making informed decisions on their new venture.


# Business Understanding / Problem Statement

Green Collar Solutions Limited is expanding into new industries to diversify its portfolio. Among those being considered by the company's stakeholders is a venture into the Aviation industries (purchasing and operating aircfats for commercial and private enterprises).My task in this project is to answer the following questions for the stakeholders.

(i). What are the risk factors associated with different aircrafts?


(ii). Do the accidents rates depend on whether the aircraft is commercial or private?


(iii). Does the model of an aircraft minimize or increase it's risk factors?


Answers to these questions will determine which model,where privately or commercially operated, has the lowest risks of getting into an accident regardless of other factors like weather or human error etc.


# Data Understanding and Analysis

Data source >>> NTSB Aviation Accidents report for the years 1962-1963.


Data description  

A dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

Data Understanding>>> data understanding and exploration using python pandas.


# Methodology for understanding the data

a) Data Selection>> identification of the relevant variables from our data

b) Data Cleaning >> Check for missing values and handle them by either dropping them altogether or replacing them with a value like mean or median(this is called imputing)

c) data Normalization

d) data aggregation - aggregate data by aircraft type with metrics like total number of accidents and their severity.


# Risk Assessment and Analysis

>Data aggregation- grouping data by aircraft category to calculate total accidents and injuries to provide a clear overview of the risk levels.

>Creating visual representations on the findings to facilitate understanding and decision making.Visualizations showcase:


(i) key risk metrics for different model of aircrafts.

(ii) comparative analysis of accidents rates

# Deliverables

summarize analysis,findings and recommendations in a comprehensive final report.
